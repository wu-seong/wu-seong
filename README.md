# Introduction 
* 👋 Hi, my name is Useong Chang. I'm 27 years old and graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Myongji University.

* 💼 I work as a backend developer, primarily using NestJS in my professional role while actively developing side projects with Spring Framework. I'm capable of building robust server applications with both technology stacks.

* 📊 Currently, I'm focused on building Observability infrastructure using Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, and various exporters in production environments. I'm also exploring OpenTelemetry (OTel) to enhance distributed tracing capabilities.

* 🏗️ I have a strong interest in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and apply its principles to create maintainable, scalable architectures in my projects.

* 📝 I believe in growing together rather than alone. I actively share my knowledge and experiences through my technical blog, contributing to the developer community.
